My name is Jacob Carella

I currently work in mechanical engineering, but i have been a hobbyist all my life. I developed an interest in computer science, and since then i have been on a self learning
journey of sorts, to try to learn about these topics that interest me, and also to go back and gain context and appreciation for some of the math topics I was exposed to in college,
my way of saying I regret my mindset back then.

I created this blog because i was inspired by reading other blogs of people who took time to create tutorials, breakdowns, etc. on mostly computer science topics. 
I also decided to create this as a way to force myself to see things through to the finish. One of the hardest things for me to get through my head and all the way to my
actions is "stop starting and start finishing". I have developed so many interests and hobbies in my life, from motorcycles to markov chains, that I have become frustrated and
upset with the feeling of trying to allocate time between all of them. Good advice from others that i have read is to focus on finishing things all the way through, before moving
to the next. This blog is to help me do that, because you cannot write about something that you paused, albeit temporarily in your mind in that moment, for something else.

Blogs that inspired me:
